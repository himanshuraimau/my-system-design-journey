# My System Design Journey 🛠️

Welcome to my personal journey into the world of system design.  
This repo is where I explore concepts, build projects, and document everything I learn about designing scalable, efficient systems.

I'm learning system design the practical way:
1. 📺 Watch a video  
2. 📖 Read an article or blog  
3. 💻 Build something hands-on

This repo is my logbook, a mix of notes, diagrams, and working code.

## 📂 Repo Structure

```

/project-name
/docs       → Notes, design writeups (HLD, LLD, tradeoffs)
/diagrams   → Architecture diagrams, flows
/code       → Working codebase (backend + infra)

```
